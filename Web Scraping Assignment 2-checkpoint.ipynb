I am a Vlogger I wanted an iPhone with 4k video by front camera and I got this phone and I am more than happy 😃\\n\\nBattery: I use this phone roughly as I am active social media person and I have a youtube channel. so the battery backup of this phone is far far better than Iphone x and I charge this phone once in a day despite of using this roughly.\\n\\n\\nDisplay: don’t go on negative reviews about display. Earlier, I was using Iphone X since 1 n half years. I didn’t see any major difference in display. The display quality is superb as it’s Apple device. You can compare one plus amoled display with Iphone 11 display you’ll get to know that Iphone 11 display is much better.\\n\\n\\nPerformance: the performance of this phone as same as Iphone 11 pro, there is 3 difference between Iphone 11 pro and Iphone 11. First is display, second you’ll get ultra wide angle camera in iphone 11 pro, and third is display Resolution. Except these things there is no difference and performance remains the same.\\n\\nWhen you’ll hold this phone you’ll feel that you are holding a premium device ❤️\\n\\nLike if my review helps.</td>\n",

Battery backup is not decent but still better than Iphone 7 and 8.Processor is fast, the phone doesn't lag at all even with heavy games, waterproof, faster face id and with no fingerprint scanners. The camera modes especially the Portrait modes \"studio light\" and \"stage light\", are way too good. So natural pics not filtered ones which you get with OnePlus phones.

You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS. Now I want to share my 1 week experience with iPhone 11. 1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week. 2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion. 3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max. 4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max. 5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing. 6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie.

Cameras were excellent even in the night 5? I have also uploaded some sample images\\n4. Performance mind blowing Apple A13 chip is super fast everything is buttery smooth\\n5. Battery 3110 mah and the optimisation of Apple and IOS 13 you will get good battery life and you will not get fast charger out of box you have to buy this separately\\n\\nThe final thing I wanna say is if you are on a budget of 60-70 go for the iPhone 11 and If you have enough money go for the iPhone 11 Pro Max don’t buy the iPhone 11 Pro (My opinion)\\nOr you can get iPhone 11 and Apple Watch series 5 with same price of 11 pro\\nThe phone is great you will not regret after buying it go for it ??</td>\n",

And I recommend this phone and seller as well.\\n\\nAnd I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days.</td>\n",

The mobile will heat up like a stove sometimes. You cannot even play Pubg even in low settings properly, performance is not a problem but heating is. Also if you play that game for 10 mins the brightness will be automatically down due to over heating even when the auto brightness is set to off. This will not be solved even if u manually increase the brightness. Cameras are the only saving grace. But for this cost it's not worth it. Finally not good for playing games like PubG.</td>\n",

It also helps with new night mode feature, which captures extremely low light images and small revolution. The rich HDR brings brilliant drama to your photos.

And i saw offer's in flipkart and made the purchase.\\nthe device is fabulous. The hardware and software quality is excellent. The new iOS is something you need to experience yourself. The drawback i found was absence of fast charger, but the pricing can compensate that. Am using Mi fast charger and things are smooth. if you are more focused to an iPhone than a show off device, this is the best iphone you should purchase.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I’d like to start by saying that the overall experience with the iPhone 11 is super smooth and amazing in every aspect. It’s an absolute powerhouse.\\n\\nPerformance - The Apple A13 Bionic is super optimised. You will not face any performance issue at all. You will never have to worry about the lag on this one.\\n\\nBattery - Battery life is one of the best you can get in a iPhone at this time. It’s better than the XR. Average use can get you more than a day and heavy use will get you through the day. Although I would suggest you to buy an 12W Apple charger (iPad technically). It won’t heat your iPhone much as the 18W and will get the job done.\\n\\nCamera - Camera is top notch. The wide angle and night mode are amazing to click photos and they give an artistic touch to your photos. Although the front camera has a slight smoothing feature which is basically due to smart HDR that smoothens your pictures like some beauty plus application. But still the camera is amazing and one of the best in market right now.\\n\\nDisplay - Display isn’t bad at all. Do not believe what they say go and see for yourselves. I know it’s a 820p display but if you’re coming from an OLED you will notice the difference otherwise it works fine for most of the people. You will get used to it after a few weeks and the vessels aren’t that noticeable too. Overall display is good.\\n\\nStorage - I’d recommend going for the 128GB variant as the iPhone 11 is capable of capturing in 4K 60fps you’ll run out soon if you click or shoot videos regularly. 128Gb is the sweet spot for all.\\n\\nColour - Purple and Green are my favourites. I personally dig the green which is technically teal so I bought the green 128gb variant. The iPhone 11s red is not similar to XRs red. The 11s red is lighter compared to XR.\\n\\nOverall - If you’re thinking to buy an iPhone I’d suggest you go for this one instead of the Pro version as the price isn’t worth it when the iPhone 11 version is getting the job done. Pro isn’t worth the money. You can keep this phone for coming 3-4 years with you considering the updates and performance.</td>\n",

Kudos to Flipkart for genuinely fast delivery.</td>\n",

This is my third iPhone.\\n\\nI shifted from android Samsung Note series to iPhone because of the strong build quality and peace of mind for next 3-4 years.\\n\\nDon’t think to much just go for it and I suggest you to go for minimum 128gb variant or more 256gb.\\n\\nI’ve attached my puppy pics and no filter used just in day light capture and see the quality for comparison.  \n",

The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.\\nIf you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.\\nCameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !  \n",

If you are using XR then still you can hold on for sometime and upgrade to 2020 model else this phone is a must buy . Camera quality is amazing and wide angle is something to count upon. Performance wise it’s amazing and feels premium while holding in hand. So a big YES for this device. Go for 128 GB variant as the 4K videos will occupy lots of space and the storage can get over very quickly. Try to buy it within some offer to get the best value for money.  \n",

Let me explain you guys about Camera, Display, battery, and performance.\\n\\nCamera: at this price range there is no comparison of camera, you’ll love the picture quality as well as video quality. I am a Vlogger I wanted an iPhone with 4k video by front camera and I got this phone and I am more than happy 😃\\n\\nBattery: I use this phone roughly as I am active social media person and I have a youtube channel. so the battery backup of this phone is far far better than Iphone x and I charge this phone once in a day despite of using this roughly.\\n\\n\\nDisplay: don’t go on negative reviews about display. Earlier, I was using Iphone X since 1 n half years. I didn’t see any major difference in display. The display quality is superb as it’s Apple device. You can compare one plus amoled display with Iphone 11 display you’ll get to know that Iphone 11 display is much better.\\n\\n\\nPerformance: the performance of this phone as same as Iphone 11 pro, there is 3 difference between Iphone 11 pro and Iphone 11. First is display, second you’ll get ultra wide angle camera in iphone 11 pro, and third is display Resolution. Except these things there is no difference and performance remains the same.\\n\\nWhen you’ll hold this phone you’ll feel that you are holding a premium device ❤️\\n\\nLike if my review helps.  \n",

I upgraded from an iPhone 8. The main issue with my 8 was battery and this phone is just awesome when it comes to battery. It lasts a day and a half for me with my regular use , internet connected always with 4g\\nCan’t move forward without saying this. Battery of this phone is a life saver when I am traveling or at work when I don’t get the option to charge\\nCamera is superb. Front cam selfies and back cam photos are just awesome.\\nSince i came from the smaller phone category which was an iPhone 8 , I found it difficult to adjust first with the size of this phone, but after the days of usage, I got very much used to it.\\nWatching a video or reading online is awesome with this bigger screen.\\nI am very much happy with this upgrade\\nI am adding few photos I have clicked. Night photography is awesome\\nThe pic in which the guy is stading was clicked at midnight 1.  \n",

The \"standard maintained\" quality of IPhone. Go for it, if your budget is not more enough for pro models. It's a value for money among the 11 series Stereo speakers are so good, you will love the stereo sound. Battery backup is not decent but still better than Iphone 7 and 8.Processor is fast, the phone doesn't lag at all even with heavy games, waterproof, faster face id and with no fingerprint scanners. The camera modes especially the Portrait modes \"studio light\" and \"stage light\", are way too good. So natural pics not filtered ones which you get with OnePlus phones. Go for it, you won't be disappointed  \n",

Phone is faster.Night shot is simply superb and detailing and colour differentiation from camera is an added advantage\\n\\nThis review I have written from iPhone 11 only and I am glad to say outside.\\n\\nCons wise if we see HD+ display only, no battery percentage indicator as in older iPhone 8.\\nNo assistive touch control button in it\\nNo oleophobic coating on back panel glass and finger prints are visible but since I bought mint green colour I felt lucky as it won’t be visible.  \n",

See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes. But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy. 1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS. Now I want to share my 1 week experience with iPhone 11. 1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week. 2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion. 3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max. 4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max. 5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing. 6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it. Should provide Fast Charging.  \n",

Netflix, Prime video all run crisply... you won’t miss a thing. True Tone works flawlessly...the display brightness is perfect. OP have not calibrated their screens properly.\\n2) iPhone 11 series have really good cameras... others have spoken in depth about them.\\n3) battery back up is fabulous\\n4) Screen is FLAT... Hence no accidental touches\\n5) ABUNDANCE OF ACCESSORY products like TEMPERED SCREEN PROTECTORS, back covers. Best is Spigen.\\n6) Phone is going to be updated for next 3 years at least.\\n7) the Face ID works fast.\\n8) All apps are designed better for iPhones.\\n9) the Phone is beautiful and people will notice.  \n",

The delivery was on time and I came in good packaging\\n2. First impression were awesome the display is not as bad as it is written in the spec list it’s the high quality LCD Panel that you will get in any phone and using dark made/light mode will not make any difference since it’s an LCD panel\\n3. Cameras were excellent even in the night 5? I have also uploaded some sample images\\n4. Performance mind blowing Apple A13 chip is super fast everything is buttery smooth\\n5. Battery 3110 mah and the optimisation of Apple and IOS 13 you will get good battery life and you will not get fast charger out of box you have to buy this separately\\n\\nThe final thing I wanna say is if you are on a budget of 60-70 go for the iPhone 11 and If you have enough money go for the iPhone 11 Pro Max don’t buy the iPhone 11 Pro (My opinion)\\nOr you can get iPhone 11 and Apple Watch series 5 with same price of 11 pro\\nThe phone is great you will not regret after buying it go for it ??  \n",

Before this I was using my google nexus 5. But moving from android to iOS is a great experience. It’s worth at this price. I will highly recommend it if you want to move to iOS. The best part of this phone is it’s camera and it’s battery life. This two things have won my heart. I loved it. Happy to have it in my hand. Still exploring its features. And can’t forget to mention Flipkart service. Very prompt service and fast delivery.  \n",

One of a kind. Best iPhone till date. Many enhancements to the camera app with many options. Love the glass body with matte finish in the lens area on the back. Lovely colours to choose from. Best battery in an iPhone till date, enough to last more than a day in normal usage. I tested my iPhone 11 battery and lasted for than 24 hours after full charge still with 30% battery charge left. Watched movies for some time. Normal usage on calls, browsing, music , connected to WiFi most of the time, even Bluetooth is on the entire time as it is connected to my Apple Watch series 5. Love the True Tone display option . Voice control option is cool where in you can control your iPhone via voice even offline. I recommend it.  \n",

I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone. And I recommend this phone and seller as well.\\n\\nAnd I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days.  \n",

The lcd display is also good.. but difference come when we watch movie in prime and Netflix, the colours are not vibrant.. as we see in amoled display.. and the charger in box is of 5 watts.. takes more than 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100.. so guys be prepare to buy 18 watts charger . Finally I am an android user, it was my first Iapple phone, I promise u guys the iOS is so smooth.. overall the phone is damn good.... close eyes to buy it.. thanks to Flipkart to deliver this amazing genuine product on time.. at last the iPhone 11 make me smile  \n",

Camera is best like before and very smooth response even in water. Don’t buy 12 mini buy iPhone 11 , it is far better than 12 mini believe me ! Have a nice day  ☺️  \n",

Excellent quality and colors the iphone have in 11 series.\\nCamera quality is just awesome and the major feel when we hold in our hands. The sound quality and volume is also higher then the previous models.\\nI will recommend to buy iphone 11 instead of pro models , there is nothing much difference as this model contains everything which fulfill our needs.\\n\\nOnly one thing that I dislike about Apple that it should give fast charger for this price of the iphone  \n",

At the beginning the battery and performance was good but it degraded soon. Also I was facing heating issues. The mobile will heat up like a stove sometimes. You cannot even play Pubg even in low settings properly, performance is not a problem but heating is. Also if you play that game for 10 mins the brightness will be automatically down due to over heating even when the auto brightness is set to off. This will not be solved even if u manually increase the brightness. Cameras are the only saving grace. But for this cost it's not worth it. Finally not good for playing games like PubG.  \n",

Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.\\n\\nP.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black  \n",

This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it. Would recommed only if you have the budget.  \n",

Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.  \n",

I must say Apple has impressed me yet again . I have been an Apple user for past 5 years . The phone is power packed with amazing features . What impressed me the most was the battery backup the phone offers . Battery can easily run upto 1.5 days in single charge with moderate to\\nHeavy usage . If you’re looking for a value for money device , I don’t see any other phone in the price range which can match the iPhone 11 .\\nOne thing I didn’t like was that ...  \n",

I had to shell out extra money for this, but I say if you can afford it, this truely is the best package.\\nMind blowing camera, battery and overall performance. Face Id works like magic even in complete darkness without firing up the screen brightness. The phones with in display fingerprint scanners do this at night time and it really burns your eyes.\\nI wanted the oneplus for its display but tbh the OLEDs on oneplus is really bad. Flickering and tint issues are really irritating. It doesn’t matter if its LCD, this display works like a charm. Especially if you use it at late night the screen is kind to your eyes.\\nMany OLEDs have this issue, thats a downside no one talks about.\\nI say go for it. You will not regret it.\\nCheers🤜🏻🤛🏻  \n",

Overall camera setup can still be enhanced and hopeful for better upgrades on software in next release\\n\\nOperating system is quite a breeze and user experience of daily usage is very high as compared to Android. I moved to iOS very swiftly in 2 days for all my office work from Note10+\\n\\nBattery holds up quite well with 4 hrs of call and some light social media usage\\n\\nFast charger not available is a big let down and my Note10+ charges in 30 mins with 40% higher Battery capacity and Iphone 11 takes min of 2 hrs\\n\\nGot this 128gb for under 59k with exchange and quite happy with performance  \n",

As they says iPhone 11 have the toughest glass ever in the smartphone which you'll find on the front and back and it's totally smooth. The fit and finish is full apple quality - there's no sense that any cheaping out has happened in the construction. Without saying it's camera features this review won't complete. The iPhone 11 has a dual camera system, consisting of a wide angle len's that's pretty much same as found on the iPhone XR last year, but now with an ultra wide angle lens to back it up great for landscapes, indoor shots, groups and architecture. It also helps with new night mode feature, which captures extremely low light images and small revolution. The rich HDR brings brilliant drama to your photos. On the front you've got an improved selfie camera that now wider field of view, though you can choose how wide you want it to be, narrow for just yourself or wide for a group.  \n",

Thanks.\\n\\n1. iPhone 11 is a pretty solid phone for the money you are paying.\\n2. All the bad reviews about the display is confusing. It’s not that bad.\\n3. I switched from a Oneplus 7t. I have no complaints about the display quality of iPhone. Yes, it’s not OLED, so, we are missing on the deep blacks. But that’s it. It is a very colour accurate display.

The iphones are always beast . The camera game has been level up . The A13 Bionic is just fabulous . The update this year are certainly the camera which is damn good with d addition of wide angle lens as well as ultra wide . If anyones purchasing an iphone for the first time , do opt for the black color . Its just feels more than premium . Battery life is damn good with lasting fully a day . Overall a nice package . Well managed and timely delivery by flipkart always . Cheers to FLIPKART 🤘🏻  \n",

Battery remains a day even if used heavily. Charger in the box is ok, but 12 or 18W could have been nothing like anything. Overall an excellent product and comfortable to use. I have got it almost a month back and so far so good.  \n",

The lightning fast bionic processor makes the phone butter smooth.Battery back up is unbeatable and best of the released iPhone.full display is still missing. however, a iPhone is a iPhone. The iPhone lovers know the value of an iPhone 🙂  \n",

And i saw offer's in flipkart and made the purchase.\\nthe device is fabulous. The hardware and software quality is excellent. The new iOS is something you need to experience yourself. The drawback i found was absence of fast charger, but the pricing can compensate that. Am using Mi fast charger and things are smooth. if you are more focused to an iPhone than a show off device, this is the best iphone you should purchase.  \n",

Thanks for the genuine product )\\nThe package came packed perfectly. The box was sealed which gave me a big relief.\\n\\nApple needs no introduction since its the dominant market player. I just love the way how IPhone 11 stands out so boldly. The moment I took it out from the box, I could feel the premium intensity. The body is remarkable and crafted for giving you a elite vibe.\\n\\nCamera is to die for. There is no other phone that can beat Apple in terms of its processor and the camera. Just flawless. Highly recommend.  \n",

       "69  I’d like to start by saying that the overall experience with the iPhone 11 is super smooth and amazing in every aspect. It’s an absolute powerhouse.\\n\\nPerformance - The Apple A13 Bionic is super optimised. You will not face any performance issue at all. You will never have to worry about the lag on this one.\\n\\nBattery - Battery life is one of the best you can get in a iPhone at this time. It’s better than the XR. Average use can get you more than a day and heavy use will get you through the day. Although I would suggest you to buy an 12W Apple charger (iPad technically). It won’t heat your iPhone much as the 18W and will get the job done.\\n\\nCamera - Camera is top notch. The wide angle and night mode are amazing to click photos and they give an artistic touch to your photos. Although the front camera has a slight smoothing feature which is basically due to smart HDR that smoothens your pictures like some beauty plus application. But still the camera is amazing and one of the best in market right now.\\n\\nDisplay - Display isn’t bad at all. Do not believe what they say go and see for yourselves. I know it’s a 820p display but if you’re coming from an OLED you will notice the difference otherwise it works fine for most of the people. You will get used to it after a few weeks and the vessels aren’t that noticeable too. Overall display is good.\\n\\nStorage - I’d recommend going for the 128GB variant as the iPhone 11 is capable of capturing in 4K 60fps you’ll run out soon if you click or shoot videos regularly. 128Gb is the sweet spot for all.\\n\\nColour - Purple and Green are my favourites. I personally dig the green which is technically teal so I bought the green 128gb variant. The iPhone 11s red is not similar to XRs red. The 11s red is lighter compared to XR.\\n\\nOverall - If you’re thinking to buy an iPhone I’d suggest you go for this one instead of the Pro version as the price isn’t worth it when the iPhone 11 version is getting the job done. Pro isn’t worth the money. You can keep this phone for coming 3-4 years with you considering the updates and performance.  \n",

Starting from speed , battery life, resolutions, camera quality, features it is superior in all department versus its predecessor. Also would like to state that at this price point it is an extraordinary value product. Recommend anyone who is looking for a highend smart phone within a range of 60k to 100K. .  \n",

First I thought display would be issue as it is a LCD with less pixels, then after using my perception changed and I never felt like I am using an outdated display. Though I also use S 10+ with Amoled display.\\n\\nSo this is perfect iPhone and a real value for money.  \n",

Overall smooth experience and everything seems so good. If you have used iOS before, you know the ease of using it.\\nLooks so secure and fast.\\nDefinately it beats my 6GB phones in performance.\\nIf you play games don't bother about RAM, the processor kills it.\\nOverall a good choice to switch from Android to iOS.\\nDon't expect that VOC charge or 108MP camera, it's iOS.

       "78  I’d like to start by saying that the overall experience with the iPhone 11 is super smooth and amazing in every aspect. It’s an absolute powerhouse.\\n\\nPerformance - The Apple A13 Bionic is super optimised. You will not face any performance issue at all. You will never have to worry about the lag on this one.\\n\\nBattery - Battery life is one of the best you can get in a iPhone at this time. It’s better than the XR. Average use can get you more than a day and heavy use will get you through the day. Although I would suggest you to buy an 12W Apple charger (iPad technically). It won’t heat your iPhone much as the 18W and will get the job done.\\n\\nCamera - Camera is top notch. The wide angle and night mode are amazing to click photos and they give an artistic touch to your photos. Although the front camera has a slight smoothing feature which is basically due to smart HDR that smoothens your pictures like some beauty plus application. But still the camera is amazing and one of the best in market right now.\\n\\nDisplay - Display isn’t bad at all. Do not believe what they say go and see for yourselves. I know it’s a 820p display but if you’re coming from an OLED you will notice the difference otherwise it works fine for most of the people. You will get used to it after a few weeks and the vessels aren’t that noticeable too. Overall display is good.\\n\\nStorage - I’d recommend going for the 128GB variant as the iPhone 11 is capable of capturing in 4K 60fps you’ll run out soon if you click or shoot videos regularly. 128Gb is the sweet spot for all.\\n\\nColour - Purple and Green are my favourites. I personally dig the green which is technically teal so I bought the green 128gb variant. The iPhone 11s red is not similar to XRs red. The 11s red is lighter compared to XR.\\n\\nOverall - If you’re thinking to buy an iPhone I’d suggest you go for this one instead of the Pro version as the price isn’t worth it when the iPhone 11 version is getting the job done. Pro isn’t worth the money. You can keep this phone for coming 3-4 years with you considering the updates and performance.  \n",

Starting from speed , battery life, resolutions, camera quality, features it is superior in all department versus its predecessor. Also would like to state that at this price point it is an extraordinary value product. Recommend anyone who is looking for a highend smart phone within a range of 60k to 100K. .  \n",

First I thought display would be issue as it is a LCD with less pixels, then after using my perception changed and I never felt like I am using an outdated display. Though I also use S 10+ with Amoled display.\\n\\nSo this is perfect iPhone and a real value for money.  \n",

Overall smooth experience and everything seems so good. If you have used iOS before, you know the ease of using it.\\nLooks so secure and fast.\\nDefinately it beats my 6GB phones in performance.\\nIf you play games don't bother about RAM, the processor kills it.\\nOverall a good choice to switch from Android to iOS.\\nDon't expect that VOC charge or 108MP camera, it's iOS. No one can beat the performance and feel of Apple.\\nOnly a small disappointed with the camera, you'll still find few noise.\\nHope this helps you decide.  \n",

The phone is true value for money, the camera is great especially the low light night photography.\\nThe processor is fast making gaming a lot of fun.\\nI read a lot of negative reviews about the display but I was using a OnePlus before and somehow the iphone 11 display is more easy on the eyes and the adaptive brightness is more effective than any of the other phones that I have used.\\nCharging is a bit slow owing to the smaller charger included in the box instead of the 18w fast charger but the long battery life compensates for it. My phone is giving me approximately 8hrs of screen time on a 90% charge.\\nOver-all it's a good buy.  \n",

Still wondering where was I lost all this while. Always thought that an iPhone is just to pricey and not worth its cost. Trust me, I didn’t regret once for this mighty purchase. It is a different ecosystem all together and I have become an Apple fan instantly. Now all my gadgets ought to be Apple. Just seamless, timeless, super smooth, flamboyant, style statement, and the list is endless. The back camera is worth the hype not the selfie camera. Sound quality is surround sound, battery works 1.5 days with 4 hours of on screen time. After 15 days of usage, more than just satisfied with Apple. Kudos to Flipkart for genuinely fast delivery.  \n",

Ballistic performance\\n2. Amazing image quality from the camera setup\\n3. Superb battery performance,\\n4. Design\\n5. Fit and finish.\\n6. iOS 13 integration with the hardware.\\nCONS:\\n1. Display quality leaves a lot to be desired. The non-1080p display is hardly noticeable during regular usage and is more than a pass. But if you are someone who use their phone for a majority of video playback, you’re in for a disappointment. Otherwise, it’s perfect for every other need.\\n2. The overall size and weight of the device is a tad too bulky for my preference.\\n3. That pathetic 5W charger. Less said the better. Get yourself that 18W ASAP.  \n",

The phone is true value for money, the camera is great especially the low light night photography.\\nThe processor is fast making gaming a lot of fun.\\nI read a lot of negative reviews about the display but I was using a OnePlus before and somehow the iphone 11 display is more easy on the eyes and the adaptive brightness is more effective than any of the other phones that I have used.\\nCharging is a bit slow owing to the smaller charger included in the box instead of the 18w fast charger but the long battery life compensates for it. My phone is giving me approximately 8hrs of screen time on a 90% charge.\\nOver-all it's a good buy.  \n",

Still wondering where was I lost all this while. Always thought that an iPhone is just to pricey and not worth its cost. Trust me, I didn’t regret once for this mighty purchase. It is a different ecosystem all together and I have become an Apple fan instantly. Now all my gadgets ought to be Apple. Just seamless, timeless, super smooth, flamboyant, style statement, and the list is endless. The back camera is worth the hype not the selfie camera. Sound quality is surround sound, battery works 1.5 days with 4 hours of on screen time. After 15 days of usage, more than just satisfied with Apple. Kudos to Flipkart for genuinely fast delivery.  "
